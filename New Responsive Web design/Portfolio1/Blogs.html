                The modern age of technology has seen a significant increase in cyberattacks against companies. This essay will discuss some past examples of these attacks and the consequences the companies had to face because of it.

                  <b>TSMC:</b>  
                <br>
                In May 2017, a ransomware attack occurred at world’s best chip manufacturing company TSMC, the ransomware was a variant of WannaCry. It’s a type of virus which locks all the data in the computer and asks money from the user in exchange for their data. The attack was not a direct attack by any hacker, but rather occurred when an employee installed corrupt software without a virus scan. The virus quickly spread itself to more than 10,000 machines in some of the company's most advanced facilities.

                Cybersecurity is the field of IT that focuses on protecting one’s data from hackers. The term cybersecurity and ethical hacking are often used interchangeably. As we rely more on technology, the demand for cybersecurity professionals are projected to increase significantly in upcoming years. This blog intends to explore the reasons for learning and not learning ethical hacking for an IT student at HCK.

                <b>Reasons for learning Cybersecurity:</b> <br><br>

                1. Our Reliance on Technology: <br>
                The main reason to learn cybersecurity would be our increasing reliance on technology. In today’s digital era, we as society and individuals rely on technology to do a lot of things. As we continue to embrace this digital era we should also put individual efforts to protect our digital selves.

            <p>
                Examinations are one of the most popular methods used to measure a student's academic worth. And just like in any system there are strategies that can be applied to excel in the examination process. In this blog, I will discuss some of the strategies I used during my recent examinations. <br> <br>

                <b> Strategy 1: Active Revision</b> <br>

                The first strategy I used was active revision through speech. I would try to articulate my knowledge of a topic to the best of my abilities. This way I would improve the information I already had and also find out the topics where I fell short. Until recently, I had not used this technique to prepare for an examination and regret not using it earlier. This technique turned out to be very efficient for getting all my information in order. But the downsides of this technique were that it consumed too much energy, I would get tired relatively quickly and it took longer for my mind to recover than it normally took.

                Reasons for choosing British education

            <p>
                Hi, I am Samip Marhajan. This is my blog for the second week of the semester and the blog is all about  my  reasons for choosing British education  over Nepalese education system. Although there are just too many reasons for choosing the British education system, I intend to quickly summarize some of the main ones. <br> <br>

                <b>3 year degree:</b> <br>

                Unlike Nepalese universities, British universities had short and dense courses. That was obvious to me when I compared the credit hours of both courses. Tribhuwan University’s CSIT course did not offer half the credit hours of IT courses in British universities. Which was one of the reasons British education was so attractive to me.

                Mobile First Approach
            </h2>
            <p>
                Mobile first design is an approach in web and app development that prioritizes the design and development of a website or app for mobile devices before designing for desktop or larger screens. This approach is becoming very popular as more and more people are using mobile devices to use websites and apps, making it important for websites and apps to be optimized for mobile use. This blog is about the benefits and drawbacks of using mobile first design approach. <br> <br>

                <b>Benefits:</b><br>

                1. Speed and Efficiency of Website: <br>

                One of the main benefits of mobile first design is that it ensures that a website or app is fully functional on a mobile device. With the most of users on mobile devices, it is important to design for these devices first to ensure that users have a positive experience on a website or app. A mobile-first design approach also leads to faster loading times, which is important as mobile users often have slower internet connections.
